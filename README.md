Look for keypress to get the game started

The game will need an array of possible words.

Use random number generator to randomly pick one of the possible words.

Place the randomly picked word into a variable like "currentWord"

Take the length of the randomly generated word and make them all underscores

When the player guesses a correct letter, change the underscore of correct letters to the letter and reduce guesses by 1.
